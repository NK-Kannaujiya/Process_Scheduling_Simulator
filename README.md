# Process Scheduling Simulator

## Description
The Process Scheduling Simulator is a tool designed to simulate and analyze various process scheduling algorithms commonly used in operating systems. 
It includes implementations of First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling algorithms.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for inputting process details and selecting scheduling algorithms.
- Visualization of process execution using Gantt charts.
- Calculation of performance metrics such as average waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.
- Educational resource for learning and experimenting with scheduling concepts.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NK-Kannaujiya/process-scheduling-simulator.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```
    cd process-scheduling-simulator
    ```

3. **Run the application:**
    - Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
    - Start the server-side application (backend).
    - Open the client-side application (frontend) in a web browser.

4. **Input process details:**
    - In the user interface, input details for each process, including arrival time, burst time, and priority (if applicable).

5. **Select a scheduling algorithm:**
    - Choose one of the available scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling) from the dropdown menu.

6. **Visualize process execution:**
    - Once process details and algorithm are selected, the simulator will visualize the execution of processes using Gantt charts.

7. **Analyze performance metrics:**
    - After simulation completion, the simulator will calculate performance metrics such as average waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.

8. **Experiment and learn:**
    - Use the simulator as an educational resource to experiment with different scheduling algorithms and understand their impact on system performance.
